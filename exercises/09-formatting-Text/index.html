		<h1>"Standing up for what you believe in is a true test of Character"</h1>
		<p>
			"When a man is confronted by others who hold ndifferent values and beliefs, A honorable man stands on what he believes is right no matter
			the pressure or cost.. Its a difficult spot to be in when you think one way and it seems like evryone else feels the opposite. They can
			try to cancel you, degrade you, and pressure you to change your stance but if you dont waver then that ,my friend, it a true measure of a
			persons character."

			<li>"The only way to fight 'Cancel Culture' is by fighting back and standing up for what their beliefs are."</li>
